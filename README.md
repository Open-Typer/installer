# Open-Typer installer configuration

This repository contains configuration files for the Qt Installer Framework.

The `repository` branch contains the latest version of Open-Typer, which is fetched by the Maintenance Tool.

## Build script

The `build.sh` script can be used to **build installer executable**, **generate repository** and push the new files.

The `repository` branch is always regenerated so that it doesn't contain obsolete git history.
